# ADR 006: Signal Protocol for End-to-End Encryption

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Accepted
**Supersedes**: ADR 002 (updates encryption protocol choice from "Signal Protocol (planned)" to "Signal Protocol (evaluated vs alternatives)")

---

## Context

Famichat requires end-to-end encryption (E2EE) from Day 1. Retrofitting encryption later would require re-architecting the message flow, database schema, and key management - making it effectively impossible to add cleanly.

The product serves families (2-6 people per household) in self-hosted neighborhood instances (100-500 total people). We need to choose an E2EE protocol that balances security, performance, and implementation complexity for this specific scale.

**Initial assumption:** Signal Protocol was chosen early in development without evaluating alternatives.

**Recent evaluation:** Considered Matrix (Megolm protocol) and MLS (IETF standard) as alternatives given:
- Industry momentum toward MLS (Wire, Google RCS)
- MLS standardization (RFC 9420, RFC 9750)
- Concerns about Signal's group scalability

---

## Decision

**Use Signal Protocol for all E2EE messaging.**

Specifically:
- **X3DH** (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) for asynchronous key agreement
- **Double Ratchet** for forward secrecy and post-compromise security
- **libsignal-client** (Rust library) via Rustler NIF integration
- **Pairwise encryption** for group messages (each recipient gets separately encrypted copy)

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: MLS (Message Layer Security - IETF)

**Evaluated:** IETF standardized group encryption protocol (RFC 9420)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Designed for large groups (logarithmic operations, scales to 1000+ members)
- ✅ Strong Post-Compromise Security (tree-based ratcheting)
- ✅ Cryptographic membership proofs (prevents server manipulation)
- ✅ Industry momentum (Wire deployed to production, Google RCS integration)
- ✅ Future-proof (IETF standard, multi-vendor interop path)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Overkill for small groups**: Tree structure overhead unnecessary for 2-6 person families
- ❌ **No deniability**: Signatures prove message authorship (vs Signal's repudiability)
- ❌ **Higher complexity**: Epoch management, group state serialization, tree operations
- ❌ **Less mature client ecosystem**: Fewer libraries, newer standard
- ❌ **Performance not better at family scale**: 150ms group operations vs Signal's 90ms for 6 people

**Why rejected:**
- MLS wins at **100+ person groups** (O(log n) vs Signal's O(n))
- Famichat has **2-6 person families** (O(6) is trivial)
- Complexity cost > security benefit at this scale

**Performance comparison (family scale):**
```
2 people:   MLS ~150ms, Signal ~30ms   → Signal 5x faster
6 people:   MLS ~150ms, Signal ~90ms   → Signal 1.7x faster
30 people:  MLS ~150ms, Signal ~450ms  → MLS 3x faster
100 people: MLS ~150ms, Signal ~2000ms → MLS 13x faster
```

**Conclusion:** MLS only wins at >20 people. Famichat families are 2-6 people.

### Alternative 2: Matrix (Megolm Protocol)

**Evaluated:** Matrix's group encryption protocol

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Proven in production (Matrix deployments worldwide)
- ✅ Better than Signal for medium groups (~110ms for 100 people)
- ✅ Simpler than MLS (sender-side ratchet, shared group key)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **No Post-Compromise Security**: Once compromised, stays compromised until manual rekey
- ❌ **Not standardized**: Matrix-specific protocol (limited interop)
- ❌ **Platform coupling**: Using Megolm implies Matrix ecosystem dependency
- ❌ **Weaker security model**: Shared group key vs MLS's continuous agreement
- ❌ **No better than Signal at family scale**: Similar performance for 2-6 people

**Why rejected:**
- Inferior security (no PCS)
- Not standardized (vendor lock-in risk)
- No performance advantage for families
- Choosing Megolm = choosing Matrix ecosystem (we want Phoenix/Elixir)

---

### Alternative 3: No E2EE (Database Encryption Only)

**Evaluated:** TLS + PostgreSQL encryption at rest

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Simplest implementation (no client-side crypto)
- ✅ Fastest performance (no encryption overhead)
- ✅ Server-side features work (search, analytics, moderation)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Admin can read messages**: Self-hosted ≠ zero-knowledge
- ❌ **Server compromise = plaintext**: Database leak exposes all messages
- ❌ **No forward secrecy**: Past messages compromised if server hacked
- ❌ **User expectation**: Modern messaging apps have E2EE (WhatsApp, Signal)

**Why rejected:**
- E2EE is table stakes for secure messaging in 2025
- Retrofitting E2EE later is architecturally impossible (different data model, key management)
- Self-hosted helps privacy but doesn't eliminate need for E2EE
- Users expect "admin cannot read messages" guarantee

## Rationale for Signal Protocol

### 1. **Right Fit for Family Scale (2-6 People)**

**Performance at family scale:**
```
Pairwise encryption cost:
- 2 people:  15ms × 2 = 30ms   ✅ Well within 200ms budget
- 4 people:  15ms × 4 = 60ms   ✅ Within budget
- 6 people:  15ms × 6 = 90ms   ✅ Within budget
- 30 people: 15ms × 30 = 450ms ⚠️ Borderline (if Layer 5 scales here)
```

**Group size reality:**
- Layer 1 (Dyad): 2 people
- Layer 2 (Triad): 3 people
- Layer 3 (Extended family): 4-6 people
- Layer 4 (Teen autonomy): Same families, different privacy model
- Layer 5 (Trusted network): 5 families × 4 people = 20-30 people

**Conclusion:** Signal performs well for Layers 1-4 (primary use case). Layer 5 may need evaluation if >30 people.

---

### 2. **Battle-Tested & Mature**

**Production deployments:**
- WhatsApp: 2+ billion users
- Signal: Millions of users, gold standard for secure messaging
- Facebook Messenger: Secret Conversations feature
- Google Messages: End-to-end encrypted RCS

**Security audits:**
- Extensively audited by cryptographers
- Known security properties (forward secrecy, post-compromise security)
- No major vulnerabilities discovered in protocol design

**Library maturity:**
- libsignal-client: Maintained by Signal Foundation
- Rust implementation (safe, fast)
- Well-documented API
- Active development and security updates

**Vs alternatives:**
- MLS: Newer (2023 standard), fewer deployments
- Megolm: Matrix-specific, less scrutiny

---

### 3. **Deniability Matters for Families**

**Signal Protocol provides deniability:**
- Messages use MAC (Message Authentication Code), not signatures
- Teen can say "I didn't send that" (plausible deniability)
- Parent can't cryptographically prove "you said X"
- Better for family trust dynamics

**MLS provides non-repudiation:**
- Messages signed with private key
- Parent can prove "teen sent this message at this time"
- Cryptographic evidence usable in conflicts
- May harm family trust

**Family context:**
- Teens need privacy AND trust
- Non-repudiation feels like surveillance
- Deniability better aligns with Layer 4 (autonomy) goals

---

### 4. **Simpler Implementation Than MLS**

**Signal Protocol complexity:**
- X3DH: Well-documented key exchange
- Double Ratchet: Stateful but straightforward
- No epoch management
- No tree operations
- Session per user pair (simple mental model)

**MLS complexity:**
- Tree-based ratcheting (complex state)
- Epoch transitions (group-level state changes)
- Commit/proposal flow (multi-step operations)
- Group state serialization (complex persistence)

**Implementation estimate:**
- Signal: 4-5 weeks (Rust NIF + libsignal + integration)
- MLS: 6-8 weeks (Rust NIF + OpenMLS + state management + debugging)

**Developer experience:**
- Signal: More documentation, examples, community support
- MLS: Newer, fewer examples, more novel debugging

---

### 5. **Forward Secrecy + Post-Compromise Security**

**Both protocols provide:**
- ✅ Forward secrecy (past messages safe if key compromised)
- ✅ Post-compromise security (future messages safe after rekey)

**Signal achieves PCS via:**
- Double Ratchet per conversation
- Automatic key rotation on every message exchange
- Compromised session heals after next message round-trip

**MLS achieves PCS via:**
- Tree-based group ratchet
- Explicit update proposals
- Compromised member heals after group update

**For families:**
- Signal's automatic per-message ratcheting = better UX (transparent)
- MLS's explicit updates = more complex (requires user action or scheduled job)

---

### 6. **Migration Path If Needed**

**If Layer 5 scales beyond 30 people and Signal becomes slow:**

**Option A:** Accept higher latency
- 450ms for 30 people still < 500ms "slow" threshold
- Infrequent (inter-family coordination, not daily chat)

**Option B:** Hybrid approach (later)
- Signal for families (Layers 1-4)
- MLS for inter-family channels (Layer 5 only)
- Complex but possible migration

**Option C:** Full MLS migration
- Requires re-implementing key management
- Months of work
- Only if Layer 5 becomes primary use case

**Current decision:** Optimize for Layers 1-4 (families). Cross bridge to Layer 5 when we get there.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Right-sized for product:** Optimized for 2-6 person families (primary use case)
2. **Battle-tested:** Billions of users, extensive security audits
3. **Deniability:** Better for family trust dynamics
4. **Simpler:** Easier to implement and maintain than MLS
5. **Performance:** 30-90ms for families (well within 200ms budget)
6. **Mature ecosystem:** libsignal-client actively maintained, good documentation

### Negative

1. **Pairwise overhead:** Performance degrades linearly with group size (O(n))
2. **Layer 5 risk:** If inter-family channels grow >30 people, may need to reconsider
3. **No cryptographic membership:** Can't prove group roster (less important for families)
4. **Not IETF standard:** Vendor-specific protocol (but de facto standard in practice)

### Neutral

1. **Migration complexity:** If we need MLS later, requires significant rework (but that's true for any protocol change)
2. **Rust dependency:** Adds Rust toolchain to build (but needed for any modern E2EE library)

## Monitoring & Re-evaluation Triggers

### Success Metrics (Layer 1-4)
- Encryption latency <100ms for 6-person family groups
- Zero BEAM crashes from NIF errors
- User-reported encryption errors <0.1% of messages

### Re-evaluation Triggers (Layer 5)
- Inter-family channels regularly exceed 20 people
- Encryption latency >400ms for common use cases
- User complaints about message send speed

**If triggered:** Evaluate hybrid approach (Signal for families, MLS for large channels)

---

## Open Questions

### Q1: Multi-device Support
**Question:** How do users access messages from multiple devices (phone + web)?

**Options:**
- Session Protocol (Signal's multi-device extension)
- Manual device linking
- Defer to post-MVP

**Decision:** Defer until Layer 2-3 validation (solve when users request it)

---

### Q2: Key Backup & Recovery
**Question:** What if user loses device? How to recover message history?

**Options:**
- Encrypted cloud backup (user-controlled passphrase)
- Social recovery (Shamir secret sharing among trusted family)
- No backup (lost device = lost history)

**Decision:** Defer until Layer 1 validation (solve when dogfooding reveals need)

---

### Q3: Layer 5 Performance
**Question:** Will Signal scale to 30-person inter-family channels?

**Answer:** Unknown until Layer 5 testing. If not:
- Option A: Accept 450ms latency (still usable)
- Option B: Hybrid (MLS for large channels only)
- Option C: Full MLS migration (months of work)

**Decision:** Test in Layer 5, pivot if needed
