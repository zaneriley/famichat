description: These rules are helpful when writing tests, following TDD, or verifying functionality of elixir code.
globs: *.exs, test/*

- When asked to follow TDD, first focus on writing out what we should be tested. Do not write code yet.
- Never test migration files. 
- Do not create new functionality or new non-test files unless you were specifically asked to get failed tests passing and it makes sense to create new files.
